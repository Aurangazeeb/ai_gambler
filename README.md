# ai_gambler
A python implementation of online gambling AI. This AI can play a game of colors in forward and reverse strategies. The stack used here is selenium, tensorflow LSTM and stacked scikit-learn classifiers. 

A simple demonstration of how to use this codebase is inside the __AI_Gambler_road_test.ipynb__ jupyter notebook.
